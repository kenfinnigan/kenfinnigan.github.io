== About me

image:/images/portrait.jpg[Ken Finnigan]

I'm a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat
with over 20 years experience with enterprises throughout the world.
Currently I'm focused on microservices, cloud and in particular https://microprofile.io/[Eclipse MicroProfile].

I'm now, mostly, a stationary nomad after growing up in Sydney, Australia.
I've lived in London, Brussels, Eindhoven, Dublin, to name a few.
Currently I'm stationary in Boston, USA,
with my wife of nearly 12 years, Erin, and our two boys.

I'm a father of two boys that constantly keep me on my toes,
but also say the darndest things all the time!

When I have some free time,
I enjoy researching family trees of my wife's, mine, and friends.
Sometimes you find some very interesting members of a family in the past!
