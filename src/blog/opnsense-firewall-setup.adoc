Over the years my home network has been powered by https://www.ui.com/introduction[Ubiquiti, window="blank"] hardware - nano HD APs,
an in-wall AP, a Flex AP, an Outdoor Mesh, network switch, and a USG.
For the most part I've been very happy with the hardware, but I've had issues with the USG a few times.

There have been occasions where upgrading the USG lead it to stop working, either requiring a factory reset and re-import of settings, or needing to rebuild the internal database.
Though I was able to ssh into the USG and rebuild the database, it was always a pain.
I often wouldn't know there was an issue until one of my kids complained about the internet not working.
Also, there were times where I felt the USG was underpowered, and restricted the total bandwidth I was able to achieve in the house.

== What to choose?

I'd put off doing anything about it for probably a year or more.
Yeah I know, the typical guy in IT putting off doing anything about their own environment!
In late 2022 I finally began looking at options for a replacement,
both from https://www.ui.com/introduction[Ubiquiti, window="blank"] and other alternatives that would still work with the existing APs I have.
I happened to be talking about it with a friend and colleague,
https://www.linkedin.com/in/alghanmi/[Rami, window="blank"],
who lives and breathes infrastructure and networking,
and he suggested I look into https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"].

I vaguely recalled having heard of https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"],
https://www.pfsense.org/[pfsense, window="blank"],
and similar firewalls over the years but hadn't delved deep their capabilities or how to set them up.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/alghanmi/[Rami, window="blank"] admitted there is more up front config required
with https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"] than an *off the shelf* solution,
but it provided a great deal more control over how it worked as well.

== What about the hardware?

As https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"] is a piece of software,
it still needs hardware to run on.
While chatting about it with https://www.linkedin.com/in/alghanmi/[Rami, window="blank"],
he suggested I look at the https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h3-plus/[ODROID-H3+, window="blank"].
I was using a small Raspberry Pi device to run https://pi-hole.net/[pihole, window="blank"],
but it was pre-assembled and I'd never really done any device building before.

After reading through the details of the https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h3-plus/[ODROID-H3+, window="blank"],
most of the *work* was already done and it was just putting pieces together,
which I could totally do!
Here is the list of components I purchased from https://www.hardkernel.com/[HARDKERNEL, window="blank"]:

* 1 x https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h3-plus/[ODROID-H3+, window="blank"]
* 2 x https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/samsung-16gb-ddr4-pc4-25600-so-dimm/[16GB DDR4 memory, window="blank"]
* 1 x https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/128gb-emmc-module-h2-2/[128GB eMMC module, window="blank"]
* 1 x https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/92x92x25mm-dc-cooling-fan-w-pwm-speed-sensor-tacho-2/[Fan, window="blank"]
* 1 x https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h3-case-type-2/[Type 2 case, window="blank"]
* 1 x https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/15v-4a-power-supply-us-plug/[15V/4A US power plug]

Once everything had arrived, it was construction time!
Above is a photo of all the components laid out ready to be put together.
The hardest part of the construction was getting the pieces of the case in the right position so they all connected correctly at the end!
It took a couple of attempts to get that sorted,
but then it came together nicely into the completed unit seen below.

== OPNsense installation

With the hardware ready, now it was time to install https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"] and get it running.
After loading the https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"] installation onto a USB stick,
I used the _dvd_ installation type, I plugged it in and booted up the device.

I chose to install FreeBSD with the ZFS file system to have journaling enabled.
I don't know whether it's necessary, but seemed like a logical approach.
When the installation of the operating system had completed,
it was unable to find any network interfaces.
At this point I was questioning whether I had made the correct decision to build a firewall myself as opposed to buying a pre-packaged solution!

As the https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h3-plus/[ODROID-H3+, window="blank"]
uses a Realtek RTL8125B network card, FreeBSD was unable to recognize it.
Luckily I found reference to the problem on a https://cyberdean.fr/blog/realtek-driver-free-bsd/[blog, window="blank"],
with handy information on how to resolve it.

I first ran `pciconf -vl` to verify the network cards were present but the driver was `none`.
Then I found a driver package for the network card from https://www.freshports.org/net/realtek-re-kmod/[FreshPorts, window="blank"],
which I downloaded and put onto another USB.
Here are the steps I took to install the network driver:

* `mkdir /mnt/usbstick`
* `ls -l /dev/da*`
* `mount -t msdosfs /dev/da1p2 /mnt/usbstick`
** `da1` is the USB stick, and `p2` was the first partition
* `pkg add /mnt/usbstick/realtek-re-kmod-v196.04.txz`
** At the time I installed the driver it was `v196`
* `umount /mnt/usbstick` and `rm -rf /mnt/usbstick`
** Unmount the USB stick and remove the directory created for it

To load the driver into the operating system we need to edit `/boot/loader.conf.local` and add the following:
```
if_re_load="YES"
if_re_name="/boot/modules/if_re.ko"
```

With the change in place, `reboot` the device.
Once booted, run `kldstat` to ensure that `if_re.ko` is loaded successfully.
Lastly, run `ifconfig -a` to verify the NIC is now present.

With the network card now detected, we can assign the interfaces with https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"].
In my case, I assigned `re0` as the WAN (the internet), and `re1` as the LAN (internal network).
Then set the IP address for the LAN and it's respective IP range,
which can be customized to your preferences.
One possible choice is an IP address of `192.168.0.1` for the LAN, and a range from `192.168.0.3` to `192.168.0.255`.

== OPNsense set up

A neat trick that https://www.linkedin.com/in/alghanmi/[Rami, window="blank"] told me was to set up the firewall inside your network!
Doing this means not interrupting the existing internet in your house until you're ready,
which is critical when you have kids that can't live without internet,
and it doesn't expose an unsecured and un-configured firewall to potential attack.
In this set up, the WAN of the device connects to your main internal network to get its internet.

To be able to access the https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"] UI from your main home network,
as it's on the WAN side of the firewall, we need to run `pfctl -d` after every reboot to disable the firewall.
As the device isn't performing any protection for us yet, there's no issue in disabling the firewall while we finish the set up.

I also installed https://tailscale.com/[Tailscale, window="blank"] by following https://tailscale.com/kb/1097/install-opnsense/[these instructions, window="blank"].

There are a couple of key things you want to verify in the UI before continuing much further.
Go to System -> Settings -> Administration and verify the following:

* HTTPS enabled for web protocol
* HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
* Disable DNS Rebinding Checks is unchecked

I then created an administrator account and disabled the root user,
by following https://homenetworkguy.com/how-to/disable-root-user-opnsense/[these instructions, window="blank"],
to increase security.
I also enabled multi-factor authentication for the administrator account,
based on https://homenetworkguy.com/how-to/enable-multi-factor-authentication-in-opnsense/[this, window="blank"].

To finish the set up of https://tailscale.com/[Tailscale, window="blank"],
head to Interfaces -> Assignments in the UI.
There should already be an interface named *tailscale* in the New Interface section,
click on the plus icon.
We need to enable the interface, and also prevent it from being removed.
Give the interface a name, set the IPv4 config to static, and set the IPv4 address to the one from https://tailscale.com/[Tailscale, window="blank"].

Next I set up the VLANs.
I wanted a separate VLAN for any server or device, another for personal computers and phones, another for work devices, and another for IoT devices.
When creating the interface for a VLAN change the IP address to have `/24`, as `/32` is the default.
If the default remains, it won't think there are any IP addresses available for use.
When all your desired VLANs have been created,
head to Services -> DHCPv4 in the UI and for each VLAN enable DHCP and set the desired IP range.

By default, access to the internet is disallowed from all VLANs,
and all VLANs can communicate with each other and the parent, which is the main LAN.
In the UI, go to Firewalls -> Rules.
For each interface name, set your preferred firewall rules.
In my case, I allowed all VLANs to access the internet,
but disallowed the IoT VLAN from talking with any other VLAN.

That's the basic set up for the https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"] firewall.
With all the above done, I took the next step and replaced the existing USG device with the new firewall!

== OPNsense and Bonjour printer

As all things do, it worked, to an extent.
All usual devices worked as expected with the new firewall, but there were a few exceptions that needed to be handled.
The first of which was the printer.

To enable printers to use the Bonjour protocol to communicate,
we need to install an mDNS repeater into https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"].
You may ask why I want to use Bonjour for printer communication,
we have several iPhones and Macs in the house,
which makes it just easier if we do.

The instructions for setting up mDNS with https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"]
are covered https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/multicast-dns.html[here, window="blank"] in detail.
First step is to install the plugin through the UI.
Once the plugin is installed, enable the service and select which network VLANs should be enabled.
In my case, I enabled it for the main LAN and the VLAN where all our personal devices are connected,
including the printer itself.

== OPNsense and a Nintendo Switch

There was still one device that was having trouble connecting to online play,
my son's Nintendo Switch!
Looking at the internet settings of the Nintendo Switch,
it was showing a NAT type of *D* when at least a *C* is recommended for best online play.

I found a great https://blog.jamie.ie/posts/switch-opnsense/[resource, window="blank"] explaining what was needed to improve it!
Under Services -> DHCPv4, find the VLAN which the Nintendo Switch is connecting to and add a new static DHCP mapping rule
with the MAC and IP of the Nintendo Switch.
Then in Firewall -> NAT -> Outbound, change *Automatic* to *Hybrid* and save the changes.
Next, create a new rule with the following properties:

* Set *Interface* to _WAN_
* Set it to use _IPv4_
* Set *Protocol* to _any_
* For *Source address*, select _Single host or Network_ and set the IP Address to that of the Nintendo Switch with `/32`
* Set *Destination address* to _any_
* Set *Static-port* to enabled

== A year of experiences

After having used https://opnsense.org/[OPNsense, window="blank"] for a year now,
and performed many minor and several major upgrades in that time,
I am impressed with how well the software performs and how smooth the upgrades are.
There have been several times where I've needed to customize specific configuration for various reasons,
but once I got the hang of the UI and how things are set up, I've found it very easy to navigate.

There was definitely a learning curve, especially in resolving the issues around network cards not being found, etc.
But I feel the experience was a great learning one, and worth it in the long run.
