I'm an OpenTelemetry Architect at https://www.lumigo.io[Lumigo, window="blank"]
with over 25 years experience with enterprises throughout the world.
I'm currently focused on building out SDK distributions for https://www.lumigo.io[Lumigo, window="blank"]
customers.
Previously, I was at Workday,
and at Red Hat for 11 years founding open source projects in middleware.

I'm now, mostly, a stationary nomad after growing up in Sydney, Australia.
I've lived in London, Brussels, Eindhoven, Dublin, to name a few.
Currently I'm stationary in Boston, USA,
with my wife of over 16 years, Erin, and our two boys.

I'm a father of two boys that constantly keep me on my toes,
but also say the darndest things all the time!

When I have some free time,
I enjoy researching family trees of my wife's, mine, and friends.
Sometimes you find some very interesting members of a family in the past!
