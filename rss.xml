&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m now almost two months into my new journey, and it&amp;#8217;s time to provide an update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_where_am_i_now&quot;&gt;Where am I now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have not already heard, I&amp;#8217;m now at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workday.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Workday&lt;/a&gt;.
My current role focuses on observability for the service teams developing SaaS applications and their related components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment,
I&amp;#8217;m investigating and learning about SLOs and SLIs.
As part of the work,
I&amp;#8217;m exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://openslo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenSLO&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloth.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sloth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_the_first_two_months&quot;&gt;The first two months&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been an exhausting but also exciting first couple of months.
There are many things I have learned about the existing observability systems and the current plans for improvements.
However, there are also many things I have yet to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tricky aspect of my learning journey to date is finding context for previous decisions.
Context is crucial to understanding previous decisions and the current state of a system based on those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many amazing people in such a short time,
both within the group I&amp;#8217;m in and across the whole organization.
It&amp;#8217;s been wonderful experiencing how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workday.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Workday&lt;/a&gt; does
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/about-workday/belonging-and-diversity.html?wdid=enus_ws_bdsol_wdnotice_wd_wd_web_19.1037&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;value inclusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_what_will_the_future_bring&quot;&gt;What will the future bring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, continued learning and growth! Interspersed with the occasional rabbit hole of information I end up in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still contributing to open source, though less on the code side at present.
Two projects of present interest are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CNCF TAG for Observability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;,
though I anticipate additional projects soon.
These two projects, in their way, are great for learning and utilizing the various parts of observability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to continuing my journey into observability and its many varied aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly 11 years at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#8217;s time to move onto a new challenge.
With so many incredible memories over my time at Red Hat it was a tough decision to make.
Especially when thinking about the amazing people I&amp;#8217;ve worked with in the past,
work with today, and have met over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_red_hat_experiences&quot;&gt;Red Hat experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first joined Red Hat it was actually Amentra,
as I started in the consulting organization which was later renamed to Red Hat Consulting.
After almost a year of being a consultant, I wanted to get back to engineering and innovating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_gatein_and_portletbridge&quot;&gt;GateIn and PortletBridge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to have an opportunity to join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gatein.jboss.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GateIn&lt;/a&gt; portal project.
My focus was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://portletbridge.jboss.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PortletBridge&lt;/a&gt;,
a library enabling the use of JSF components in portlets.
Most of the work involved working with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://richfaces.jboss.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;RichFaces&lt;/a&gt; project
to fix and verify as many components as possible worked in portlets.
If memory serves,
we were able to get it from about 70-80 components working to all 100+ components.
There were many challenges as JSF and Portlets had very different lifecycles!
One of my proudest moments was implementing a CDI scope for portlets,
with some guidance from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/julienviet?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Julient Viet&lt;/a&gt;,
which later was added to the PortletBridge specification in the JCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_liveoak&quot;&gt;LiveOak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the popularity of portals waned,
I was privileged, and honored, to work side by side with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobmcwhirter?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bob McWhirter&lt;/a&gt;
to define an architecture for an MBaaS (Mobile backend as a service) built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://netty.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Netty&lt;/a&gt;.
We called the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/liveoak-io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LiveOak&lt;/a&gt;.
It was some of the most challenging engineering work I&amp;#8217;ve ever done,
but also extremely fulfilling to see it come together.
We had some great ideas around representing everything as an URL addressable resource,
even databases!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked on LiveOak for a couple of years until Red Hat bought FeedHenry.
It was a very sad day for me when LiveOak was shuttered,
I really felt it had a chance to be something big.
After LiveOak,
I explored a few different things to work on.
I ended up shifting to Developer Tooling for a short while working on WebIDEs,
and an &quot;all-in-one&quot; installer to provide all the necessary tools for developing with containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_wildfly_swarm&quot;&gt;WildFly Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opportunity came up to work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobmcwhirter?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bob McWhirter&lt;/a&gt; again
for a new take on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wildfly.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WildFly&lt;/a&gt; targeted at microservices.
Thus &lt;a href=&quot;https://thorntail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WildFly Swarm&lt;/a&gt; was born.
For at least the first 6 months,
I can&amp;#8217;t remember exactly how long,
it was only Bob and I working on it.
We had a great time bouncing ideas off each other and exploring different avenues.
Over time interest in microservices and uber jars grew, and so did the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_microprofile_and_smallrye&quot;&gt;MicroProfile and SmallRye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was exciting to be involved in forming &lt;a href=&quot;https://microprofile.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, along with IBM, Tomitribe, Payara, and London Java Community (LJC).
&lt;a href=&quot;https://microprofile.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt; was a great opportunity to learn more about microservices
developed for the cloud and what they need above and beyond Java to be successful.
We made some misteps over the years,
but hopefully continue to learn and grow from them.
With the desire for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wildfly.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WildFly&lt;/a&gt; to also include &lt;a href=&quot;https://microprofile.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt;,
there was an opportunity to have re-use between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wildfly.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WildFly&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://thorntail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WildFly Swarm&lt;/a&gt;.
I pushed hard for the creation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallrye.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SmallRye&lt;/a&gt; as a shared home for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://microprofile.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt; implementations.
There was some immediate community building with OpenAPI,
but other projects took some time to garner additional contributors,
while others remained purely as a vehicle for Red Hat to share implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_thorntail&quot;&gt;Thorntail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it was around the time we created &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallrye.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SmallRye&lt;/a&gt;,
that WildFly Swarm was renamed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thorntail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Thorntail&lt;/a&gt;.
It would&amp;#8217;ve been so cool if we could have found somewhere to make a plushy version of the logo!
No such luck unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2018 I&amp;#8217;d spent a few months completely re-architecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://thorntail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Thorntail&lt;/a&gt;
to have CDI at the very core of the runtime.
It was tricky to figure out the right pieces initially,
but once it started coming together it was so much easier to manage than the previous model.
Also, each of the extensions, what we called &quot;fractions&quot;, needed way less code than the previous model.
The work was stopped when we first started the PoC for &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_quarkus&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure and a privelege to be a part of the small team working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt; from day one.
It was a little sad to be moving on from &lt;a href=&quot;https://thorntail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Thorntail&lt;/a&gt;,
but it was great to be able to build on all the learnings from &lt;a href=&quot;https://thorntail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Thorntail&lt;/a&gt;
and combine it with AOT (Ahead of Time compilation) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt; for a while,
I had the pleasure of handing over &lt;a href=&quot;https://thorntail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Thorntail&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_ladicek?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ladislav Thon&lt;/a&gt;.
It wasn&amp;#8217;t the easiest for him to take on a project he knew would end one day,
but he did so with distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years of working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://smallrye.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SmallRye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://microprofile.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt;,
it was time to hand over the reins of being the Technical Architect for Red Hat at MicroProfile.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/radcortez?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Roberto Cortez&lt;/a&gt; jumped in to take over
&lt;a href=&quot;https://smallrye.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SmallRye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://microprofile.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt;
with incredible enthusiasm.
I&amp;#8217;ve been very happy to see what he&amp;#8217;s achieved in the last year or so,
and look forward to seeing what he continues to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_observability&quot;&gt;Observability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 12 to 18 months I&amp;#8217;ve still been working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt;,
focused on the observability aspects.
It all started when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ebullientworks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Erin Schnabel&lt;/a&gt; shared
concerns with MicroProfile Metrics and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Micrometer&lt;/a&gt;
is a mature library for metrics better suited to what SREs need to monitor Java applications.
I can&amp;#8217;t thank Erin enough
for opening my eyes to look beyond what might be more familiar to find gems from the wider ecosystem.
Erin brings energy and enthusiasm to her work
that is infectious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My observability journey began with &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Micrometer&lt;/a&gt;,
but quickly included &lt;a href=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; as most vendors in the space were contributing.
I&amp;#8217;ve not contributed much to &lt;a href=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; so far,
but it&amp;#8217;s been a tremendous and welcoming experience dealing with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_thanks_to_everyone&quot;&gt;Thanks to everyone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my time at Red Hat draws to a close, at least for now,
I want to profusely thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nmcl?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mark Little&lt;/a&gt; for his guidance
and mentorship over the years.
I look forward to continuing our relationship,
hopefully catching up at a conference at some point!
I also want to thank all my managers over the years for helping to guide my growth,
as well as all the fantastic team members I&amp;#8217;ve had the pleasure to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to wish everyone on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt; team continued success in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_whats_next&quot;&gt;What&amp;#8217;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have a short break after Red Hat before beginning a new journey.
Where I&amp;#8217;m heading and what I&amp;#8217;m up to will be for another post in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been over a year since I first created this blog with the goal of posting more.
It went so well that I&amp;#8217;ve no posts until now,
and I decided to move the blog to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/a&gt; as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Hugo wasn&amp;#8217;t too bad to set up and get working with Asciidoc content,
the theme I&amp;#8217;d chosen didn&amp;#8217;t make it easier to figure out,
and I didn&amp;#8217;t really understand how to tweak pieces if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explored a few options in deciding on an alternative blog platform,
as there are plenty to choose from.
As I had some previous experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;,
using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be a good fit.
Though I had no previous experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphql.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;,
it seemed like a good opportunity to learn it.
It was a little challenging to get to grips with in the beginning,
but the docs are very thorough, so I managed to work through any issues without much hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future post I will cover the details of getting Asciidoc transformation
working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;#8217;m very happy with the choice,
and have found it reasonably easy to write components in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;
and retrieve the data with &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphql.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introduction]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's definitely weird to think that this is the first time I will have had a personal blog in the over 20 years that I've been working with technology of various kinds...]]></description><link>https://kenfinnigan.me/blog/introduction/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://kenfinnigan.me/blog/introduction/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ken Finnigan]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s definitely weird to think that this is the first time I will have had a personal blog in the over 20
years that I&amp;#8217;ve been working with technology of various kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not so weird when I think that it&amp;#8217;s probably been on my &lt;strong&gt;todo list&lt;/strong&gt; for nearly 10 of those years.
Possibly longer.
It&amp;#8217;s actually been on my list so long I can&amp;#8217;t be sure how long it&amp;#8217;s been there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I finally pulled out the proverbial finger and put together a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_a_bit_about_me&quot;&gt;A bit about me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working on open source projects for about 10 years or so now,
and I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed every minute of being part of something in each of the communities that I&amp;#8217;ve participated in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, being able to contribute to open source projects while working for Red Hat has been fantastic.
It makes the job even more rewarding being able to participate openly with communities of different projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always enjoyed playing with computers,
and in particular programming on them.
The first computer my family had in the early 80&amp;#8217;s was a Commodore 64.
At the time it seemed like the games were so amazing!
A couple of years after that we upgraded to the Commodore 128D,
which is when I really began learning to program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first computer that was mine alone,
I bought a second hand XT from Gateway with my pocket money.
It was 1987 and it had a whopping 20MB HDD and 1280Kb RAM,
and of course the wonderful 5 1/4&quot; floppy drive!
My dad would bring home old versions of software they&amp;#8217;d been using at his work for me to play around with.
I spent many hours installing dBase IV, Lotus 1-2-3, and the like.
Continually switching through up to a dozen floppy disks to complete an installation.
Those were the days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_what_will_this_blog_be_about&quot;&gt;What will this blog be about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure it will have a defined theme or group of topics right now.
It will very much depend on how my interests change and what I might be working on at a specific time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can say is that there&amp;#8217;s definitely going to be topics on computing,
most likely focusing around software development, microservices, and cloud.
I may also talk about interesting genealogical things I find in doing my research.
Some of which could cross over into software related to genealogy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you may find the odd post about family life or vacations we have taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_last_words&quot;&gt;Last words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the above is a round about way of saying,
&lt;em&gt;this blog won&amp;#8217;t be for everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate,
I hope from time to time you find interesting topics I&amp;#8217;ve discussed here.
And if you do, please let me know.
I may decide to talk deeper about those topics that others also find of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, Ken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
