class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There&#8217;s a <em>Feedback Chasm</em> between our current role and any future one.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We receive a variety of feedback from many people throughout our careers.\nFeedback from our current role\nis from an environment we&#8217;re familiar and, hopefully, comfortable in.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In this post I talk about the <em>Feedback Chasm</em> and why it&#8217;s a problem.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_current_role_feedback\">Current Role Feedback</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Any role we&#8217;re in, we receive feedback from many people.\nFrom managers, mentors, peers, and direct reports, to name a few.\nHopefully feedback is given freely and openly.\nAnd more frequently than yearly performance reviews.\nWith any feedback we receive,\nwe are free to choose whether to act on that feedback, or not.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The feedback we receive is often targeted at our current role.\nHow we&#8217;re doing as a leader, manager, engineer, or whatever role we&#8217;re in.\nWhat we need to do for promotions, raises,\nor other future roles in the same company.\nWe may also receive feedback which is generally applicable to any role,\nbut less frequently.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_future_role_feedback\">Future Role Feedback</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When interviewing for a new role at a new company,\nwe don&#8217;t consider the importance of feedback.\nWe&#8217;re focused on the interview itself,\nand whether we&#8217;re a good fit for the team and company.\nWe rely on our existing skills and experience from current and previous roles,\nhoping they&#8217;re enough.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What happens when our current skills are not enough?\nWe don&#8217;t get an offer,\nand we&#8217;re often left wondering why.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sometimes we do get feedback,\nbut it can be vague and not actionable.\nWe&#8217;re left to our own devices to figure out what to do next.\nAre we lacking in certain skills?\nDo I need more technical or soft skills?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is the <em>Feedback Chasm</em>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_the_feedback_chasm\">The Feedback Chasm</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The feedback we receive for our current role,\nis often not the same feedback we need to land a future role.\nFeedback from interviewing for a new role is key to bridging the gap.\nWithout this feedback,\nwe&#8217;re destined to never reach the next step in our careers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Why do we not receive feedback when interviewing?\nThere can be many reasons as to why.\nSometimes it&#8217;s a lack of time to distill the internal comments into shareable feedback.\nOther times companies do not want to give specific feedback,\nfor fear of revealing too much information about their internal processes.\nIt could also be a fear of lawsuits,\nor simply a lack of understanding of the importance of feedback for a candidate.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Without receiving feedback from the interviewing process,\nwe won&#8217;t know how to improve.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As candidates,\ninterviewing requires a significant time investment.\nWe spend several hours in interviews, and more outside of them.\nPreparing for interviews,\nwriting interview notes,\nresearching a company, and more.\nIt&#8217;s not unreasonable to expect a small amount of feedback for the time invested.\nSurely a few pieces of feedback could be provided in less than half an hour.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_jumping_the_feedback_chasm\">Jumping the Feedback Chasm</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>How can we reach the other side of the <em>Feedback Chasm</em>?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One approach is ensuring we have mentors outside our current company.\nThey could be former colleagues, or people you&#8217;ve met throughout your career.\nAttending conferences, online groups, or local user groups, there are many places to find a mentor.\nEven if they have not worked at the company you want to join,\ntheir feedback can be invaluable.\nWhat you want is for their feedback to differ from what you receive at any current role.\nThe differing perspectives and opinions are key to growing beyond your current company and role.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What else can we do?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Some companies will offer to connect you with employees directly to hear about the culture and work environment.\nThis typically occurs once you&#8217;ve had an interview or two already,\nso will not be of help in the early stages of the interview process.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However, the largest benefit comes from the industry placing a higher importance on providing feedback to candidates.\nWithout this feedback,\nwe&#8217;re destined to continue making it difficult for everyone to land their dream job.\nGranted,\nnot all feedback we receive may be useful,\nor which we want to act on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>But it&#8217;s a better place than not knowing anything.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <em>Feedback Chasm</em> is a problem for the industry.\nWe&#8217;re increasing the likelihood of limiting people&#8217;s potential for growth.\nFeedback is the engine driving our growth.\nWhat that engine propelling us,\nor being limited to small sets of feedback,\nwe may not reach where we want to go.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We need to ensure we&#8217;re getting feedback from many different avenues,\nboth internally and externally.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However, the largest pieces of potentially career changing feedback we receive,\nneeds to come from the interview process itself.\nThe industry must change it&#8217;s approach to providing feedback,\nand give it freely.\nCandidates invest a large amount of time in the process with no guarantees.\nThe company should want to provide feedback to help them improve,\nincreasing the chance of them being a future employee.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","document":{"title":"The Feedback Chasm"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/feedback-chasm/"},"pageAttributes":{"title":null,"description":null,"date":"September 24,
