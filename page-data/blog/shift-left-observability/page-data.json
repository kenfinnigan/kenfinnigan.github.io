alongside their code\nis critical to their success.\nIt also introduces observability practices into the full developer lifecycle,\nincluding observing CI/CD pipelines.\nLeading to improvements in the developer lifecycle task speed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In this post I want to talk about a key piece of shifting observability left.\nOne I consider more important than the others.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_a_history_of_shifting_left\">A History of Shifting Left</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Larry Smith describes <em>Shift-Left Testing</em> his <a href=\"https://www.drdobbs.com/shift-left-testing/184404768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2001 article</a>.\nHe details how to utilize QA in earlier phases of development.\nHelping reduce bugs while improving development speed,\nremove rework in later stages.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#DevSecOps,_shifting_security_left\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DevSecOps</a>\nuses the same philosophy to bring security further left in the DevOps process.\nDevSecOps seeks to find security issues in code,\nwell before reaching production.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jedi.be/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patrick Debois</a> coined the DevOps and DevSecOps terms around 2009.\nSome of the concepts underpinning these philosophies have been prevalent in the industry for a while.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><em>Shift Left</em> approaches, irrespective of what for,\ntend to focus on the technological aspect.\nTesting code for security flaws on check-in,\nbringing observability data into developers IDEs, etc.\nHowever, the larger benefit,\nin my mind,\nis developers including these aspects when they&#8217;re planning and designing an application.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>What do I mean by that?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Two decades ago,\napplication developers would typically build an application in isolation.\nWhen it was complete,\nthe application would be reviewed by a central security team.\nI saw many applications being rejected at this stage,\nrequiring large time spent on resolving the discovered issues.\nIn some cases,\ncomplete application rewrites were required.\nRetro-fitting the security changes into the existing application architecture was not possible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Security became an integral part of designing applications with the advent of cloud computing.\nIt could no longer be bolted on at the end of application development.\nCareful thought and planning is required before writing a single line of code,\nto successfully incorporate security.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I firmly believe developers knowing the importance of security,\nand how to implement it,\nreduces the number of security incidents of an application.\nIn addition,\ntotal development time improves by removing effort caused by re-work.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_shift_left_observability\">Shift Left Observability</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We talked about the history of <em>Shift Left</em>,\nincluding DevSecOps and shifting security left.\nNow,\nlet&#8217;s discuss observability,\nanother orthogonal concern of application development.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As mentioned above,\n<em>Shift Left Observability</em> has come to prominence over the last few years.\nThere have been many articles on the topic,\nincluding <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/shifting-left-observability-in-practice-an-overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shifting Left Observability in Practice</a> on <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New Stack</a>.\nArticles such as this focus on the technical aspects in the developers' lifecycle.\nThey fail to bring observability further left into the application design phase.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When I say <em>Application Observability Design</em>,\nI&#8217;m referring to the process of evaluating a service or application to determine its observability needs.\nEvery service has different needs,\nnegating a <em>one size fits all</em> approach to observability.\nThere may be services with similar needs for observability,\nbut it&#8217;s rare for them to be completely identical.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We will come back to not including <em>Application Observability Design</em> with <em>Shift Left Observability</em>.\nLet&#8217;s briefly talk about OpenTelemetry.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_opentelemetry\">OpenTelemetry</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenTelemetry</a> is an extremely large open-source project.\nIt consists of many sub-projects.\nA key goal of <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenTelemetry</a> is\na vendor neutral method of collecting and transmitting telemetry data for observability.\nHaving contributed to a couple of sub-projects myself,\nI can attest to the dedication and commitment of those involved.\nThey work continuously on a very challenging problem,\nand have made progress in a short period of time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenTelemetry</a> also provides lots of instrumentations for\nframeworks across languages.\nDepending on the language,\nit&#8217;s also possible for the instrumentations to be automatically applied.\nWhile this is fantastic,\nand simplifies the process of generating telemetry,\nit does introduce challenges.\nWhich telemetry is the correct telemetry for any specific service?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenTelemetry</a> contributors use their judgment and experience\nin determining what telemetry data provides the most useful information.\nTheir experiences may differ to a service you are building,\ncreating a misalignment in generated telemetry.\nThe information you need to correctly observe the service will not be present.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To be clear,\nthis is not the fault of the <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenTelemetry</a> project.\nIt&#8217;s one of developer education,\nand ensuring the business allows developers the time they need for it.\nThere is the need, however,\nto recognize all services are different.\nAs such,\ntheir telemetry requirements will differ.\nTelemetry requirements will also depend on the organizational structure.\nIs it Ops or Dev supporting the service?\nIs there a mixture depending on incident severity?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_what_telemetry_to_use\">What Telemetry to use?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As part of the <em>Shift Left Observability</em> approach,\ndevelopers need to spend time thinking about how their service will be operated.\nNot only once their operating a service,\nbut during initial design phases too.\nThis information helps determine which telemetry data is necessary for operating a service with resiliency and scalability.\nWhen a developer takes advantage of pre-defined instrumentation libraries,\nit increases the risks of bloating the size of collected telemetry;\nincreasing the costs of collection and storage,\nand complicating the telemetry for operational support of a service.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Yes,\nthere are many tools available for filtering and modifying telemetry streams,\nboth open-source and commercial.\nHowever,\nit&#8217;s not possible to effectively scale down the telemetry volume without knowing which telemetry data is needed.\nEvaluating the desired telemetry for service operation and debugging is critical.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Will developers think of all the required telemetry from day one?\nAbsolutely not.\nAdditional telemetry will need to be added over time.\nHowever, it&#8217;s a more efficient approach than capturing all possible telemetry data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Being mindful of telemetry volume and cost is critical.\nBoth for observability data usefulness,\nand cost to the business.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_summary\">Summary</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <em>Shift Left Observability</em> approach will continue bringing benefits to the developer lifecycle.\nA companion piece,\nnot often associated with the approach,\nis <em>Application Observability Design</em>.\nDevelopers need to carefully consider the telemetry requirements of their service or application.\nEven when modifying an already existing service.\n<em>Application Observability Design</em> isn&#8217;t a great term to represent what developers should do,\nbut it does emphasize the work that needs to happen.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s utilizing SLOs/SLIs for a service,\nGolden metrics,\nRED metrics,\nor any other approach to defining a set of telemetry a service needs,\ndefining the required telemetry data is a necessary step.\nDon&#8217;t default to collecting everything possible.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","document":{"title":"Shift Left Observability, more than
