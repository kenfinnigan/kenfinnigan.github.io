class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We’ve all been there: staring at an online code editor, heart hammering,\ntrying to conjure a perfectly optimized algorithm while an interviewer(s) looks on expectantly.\nCoding interviews have become a standard practice for tech companies,\nbut are they really the best way to assess a developer’s potential or their skills?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I’d argue they’re not even close.\nIn fact, they might be doing more harm than good.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_the_pressure_cooker_fallacy\">The Pressure Cooker Fallacy</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Coding interviews are notorious for putting candidates under immense pressure.\nIn these scenarios, developers are expected to solve complex problems with minimal preparation,\nand often without full context.\nYou’re tasked with writing code under the watchful eyes of one or two interviewers,\nas they evaluate your every keystroke.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is hardly reflective of real-world software development.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Modern development is collaborative, iterative, and often involves plenty of discussion, debugging, and — let’s be real — Googling.\nThe environment in a coding interview is a far cry from the day-to-day experience,\nwhere developers work in teams, take the time to fully understand problems, and build solutions with care.\nWriting clean, maintainable code in the real world is a thoughtful,\nmeasured process — nothing like the high-stress race to solve an algorithm in 30 minutes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I appreciate the interviewer(s) is seeking to understand a candidates thought process,\nbut this approach is unnatural for most people.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_rote_learning_vs_real_skills\">Rote Learning vs. Real Skills</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many coding interview questions have become predictable,\nto the point where a quick search online will uncover a list of common problems and their optimal solutions.\nWhile it’s true that preparation is important for any interview,\nwhat we’re really testing here is how well candidates can memorize algorithms,\nrather than their ability to think critically or write maintainable code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Yes, they might be able to churn out a sorting algorithm on the spot.\nBut can they navigate a complex codebase, identify subtle bugs, and contribute to a system that needs to be maintained by a team over time?\nThat’s the real test of a developer’s skill, and it’s largely absent from the coding interview process.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_the_art_of_the_merge_what_we_should_be_testing\">The Art of the Merge: What We Should Be Testing</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the real world, developers don’t just write new code from scratch.\nThey spend much of their time adding features to existing systems,\nreviewing code written by colleagues, and debugging issues that crop up in established projects.\nThis is where we should focus our attention when evaluating candidates.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Code Reviews:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A more realistic evaluation would involve asking candidates to review a pull request.\nCan they offer constructive feedback?\nDo they recognize potential issues or suggest better alternatives?\nThis is much closer to the collaborative process of building software in a team.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\" start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Enhancing Existing Code:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Instead of giving a clean slate problem, ask the candidate to add a feature to an existing codebase.\nThis mimics the everyday reality of a developer’s job, where they need to work within the constraints of an established architecture.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\" start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p>Debugging:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Debugging is one of the most important and time-consuming aspects of software development.\nRather than testing someone’s ability to write a complex algorithm in 30 minutes,\nit’s far more telling to see how they approach diagnosing and fixing a bug in a larger system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Granted, these approaches can be more complex to implement for an interview,\nbut the payoff is an improved approach to candidate evaluation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_experience_matters\">Experience Matters</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For recent graduates or developers with limited professional experience,\ncoding interviews can still serve as a reasonable way to gauge their problem-solving skills and fundamental knowledge.\nBut for more seasoned developers, these interviews fall short.\nA developer with years of experience should be evaluated based on their track record — the projects they’ve shipped,\nthe systems they’ve worked on, and their public code contributions, if available.\nThese give a far more nuanced picture of a developer’s capabilities than whether they can code FizzBuzz.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_a_better_path_forward\">A Better Path Forward</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There’s a smarter way to assess developer talent.\nLet’s consider moving away from the outdated model of high-pressure coding or whiteboard challenges and incorporate more realistic assessments.\nCode reviews, debugging exercises, and discussions about past projects give a better understanding of how a developer operates in the real world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The myth that coding interviews are the ultimate test of a developer’s ability needs to be put to rest.\nWhat we should be looking for is the ability to collaborate,\nthink critically, and produce maintainable, high-quality code.\nSkills that are much more representative of what a developer actually does on a daily basis.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Let’s move towards an interview process that reflects the collaborative, problem-solving nature of modern software development.\nAfter all, when was the last time you had to solve an algorithm problem in under 30 minutes while your boss stood over your shoulder?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","document":{"title":"The Coding Interview: Why They Don’t Tell the Whole
