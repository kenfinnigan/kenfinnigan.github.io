class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After nearly 11 years at <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Red Hat</a> it&#8217;s time to move onto a new challenge.\nWith so many incredible memories over my time at Red Hat it was a tough decision to make.\nEspecially when thinking about the amazing people I&#8217;ve worked with in the past,\nwork with today, and have met over the years.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_red_hat_experiences\">Red Hat experiences</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When I first joined Red Hat it was actually Amentra,\nas I started in the consulting organization which was later renamed to Red Hat Consulting.\nAfter almost a year of being a consultant, I wanted to get back to engineering and innovating.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_gatein_and_portletbridge\">GateIn and PortletBridge</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I was lucky enough to have an opportunity to join the <a href=\"https://gatein.jboss.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GateIn</a> portal project.\nMy focus was on <a href=\"https://portletbridge.jboss.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PortletBridge</a>,\na library enabling the use of JSF components in portlets.\nMost of the work involved working with the <a href=\"https://richfaces.jboss.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RichFaces</a> project\nto fix and verify as many components as possible worked in portlets.\nIf memory serves,\nwe were able to get it from about 70-80 components working to all 100+ components.\nThere were many challenges as JSF and Portlets had very different lifecycles!\nOne of my proudest moments was implementing a CDI scope for portlets,\nwith some guidance from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/julienviet?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Julient Viet</a>,\nwhich later was added to the PortletBridge specification in the JCP.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_liveoak\">LiveOak</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When the popularity of portals waned,\nI was privileged, and honored, to work side by side with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobmcwhirter?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bob McWhirter</a>\nto define an architecture for an MBaaS (Mobile backend as a service) built on top of <a href=\"https://netty.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netty</a>.\nWe called the project <a href=\"https://github.com/liveoak-io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LiveOak</a>.\nIt was some of the most challenging engineering work I&#8217;ve ever done,\nbut also extremely fulfilling to see it come together.\nWe had some great ideas around representing everything as an URL addressable resource,\neven databases!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We worked on LiveOak for a couple of years until Red Hat bought FeedHenry.\nIt was a very sad day for me when LiveOak was shuttered,\nI really felt it had a chance to be something big.\nAfter LiveOak,\nI explored a few different things to work on.\nI ended up shifting to Developer Tooling for a short while working on WebIDEs,\nand an \"all-in-one\" installer to provide all the necessary tools for developing with containers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_wildfly_swarm\">WildFly Swarm</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>An opportunity came up to work with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobmcwhirter?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bob McWhirter</a> again\nfor a new take on <a href=\"https://www.wildfly.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WildFly</a> targeted at microservices.\nThus <a href=\"https://thorntail.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WildFly Swarm</a> was born.\nFor at least the first 6 months,\nI can&#8217;t remember exactly how long,\nit was only Bob and I working on it.\nWe had a great time bouncing ideas off each other and exploring different avenues.\nOver time interest in microservices and uber jars grew, and so did the project.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_microprofile_and_smallrye\">MicroProfile and SmallRye</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It was exciting to be involved in forming <a href=\"https://microprofile.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MicroProfile</a> in 2016, along with IBM, Tomitribe, Payara, and London Java Community (LJC).\n<a href=\"https://microprofile.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MicroProfile</a> was a great opportunity to learn more about microservices\ndeveloped for the cloud and what they need above and beyond Java to be successful.\nWe made some misteps over the years,\nbut hopefully continue to learn and grow from them.\nWith the desire for <a href=\"https://www.wildfly.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WildFly</a> to also include <a href=\"https://microprofile.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MicroProfile</a>,\nthere was an opportunity to have re-use between <a href=\"https://www.wildfly.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WildFly</a> and\n<a href=\"https://thorntail.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WildFly Swarm</a>.\nI pushed hard for the creation of <a href=\"https://smallrye.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmallRye</a> as a shared home for\n<a href=\"https://microprofile.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MicroProfile</a> implementations.\nThere was some immediate community building with OpenAPI,\nbut other projects took some time to garner additional contributors,\nwhile others remained purely as a vehicle for Red Hat to share implementations.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_thorntail\">Thorntail</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I think it was around the time we created <a href=\"https://smallrye.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmallRye</a>,\nthat WildFly Swarm was renamed to <a href=\"https://thorntail.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thorntail</a>.\nIt would&#8217;ve been so cool if we could have found somewhere to make a plushy version of the logo!\nNo such luck unfortunately.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In early 2018 I&#8217;d spent a few months completely re-architecting <a href=\"https://thorntail.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thorntail</a>\nto have CDI at the very core of the runtime.\nIt was tricky to figure out the right pieces initially,\nbut once it started coming together it was so much easier to manage than the previous model.\nAlso, each of the extensions, what we called \"fractions\", needed way less code than the previous model.\nThe work was stopped when we first started the PoC for <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quarkus</a>!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_quarkus\">Quarkus</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It was a pleasure and a privelege to be a part of the small team working on <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quarkus</a> from day one.\nIt was a little sad to be moving on from <a href=\"https://thorntail.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thorntail</a>,\nbut it was great to be able to build on all the learnings from <a href=\"https://thorntail.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thorntail</a>\nand combine it with AOT (Ahead of Time compilation) in <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quarkus</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Having worked on <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quarkus</a> for a while,\nI had the pleasure of handing over <a href=\"https://thorntail.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thorntail</a>\nto <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_ladicek?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ladislav Thon</a>.\nIt wasn&#8217;t the easiest for him to take on a project he knew would end one day,\nbut he did so with distinction.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After a couple of years of working on <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quarkus</a>,\n<a href=\"https://smallrye.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmallRye</a>, and <a href=\"https://microprofile.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MicroProfile</a>,\nit was time to hand over the reins of being the Technical Architect for Red Hat at MicroProfile.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/radcortez?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roberto Cortez</a> jumped in to take over\n<a href=\"https://smallrye.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmallRye</a> and <a href=\"https://microprofile.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MicroProfile</a>\nwith incredible enthusiasm.\nI&#8217;ve been very happy to see what he&#8217;s achieved in the last year or so,\nand look forward to seeing what he continues to accomplish.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_observability\">Observability</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the last 12 to 18 months I&#8217;ve still been working on <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quarkus</a>,\nfocused on the observability aspects.\nIt all started when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ebullientworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erin Schnabel</a> shared\nconcerns with MicroProfile Metrics and how <a href=\"https://micrometer.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Micrometer</a>\nis a mature library for metrics better suited to what SREs need to monitor Java applications.\nI can&#8217;t thank Erin enough\nfor opening my eyes to look beyond what might be more familiar to find gems from the wider ecosystem.\nErin brings energy and enthusiasm to her work\nthat is infectious!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>My observability journey began with <a href=\"https://micrometer.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Micrometer</a>,\nbut quickly included <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenTelemetry</a> as most vendors in the space were contributing.\nI&#8217;ve not contributed much to <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenTelemetry</a> so far,\nbut it&#8217;s been a tremendous and welcoming experience dealing with the community.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_thanks_to_everyone\">Thanks to everyone</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As my time at Red Hat draws to a close, at least for now,\nI want to profusely thank <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmcl?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark Little</a> for his guidance\nand mentorship over the years.\nI look forward to continuing our relationship,\nhopefully catching up at a conference at some point!\nI also want to thank all my managers over the years for helping to guide my growth,\nas well as all the fantastic team members I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to work with.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I want to wish everyone on the <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/\"

next?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I will have a short break after Red Hat before beginning a new journey.\nWhere I&#8217;m heading and what I&#8217;m up to will be
